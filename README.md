# Animation
The purpose of animation is to learn to render and modify sprites.
## 📁 animation/hero

## 📁 animation/movement
This is where creativity meets mathematics.The purpose of movements is to allow a certain movement to objects(like floating blocks or bridges/elevators that return to their original position) or enemy sprites(like guards that move to and fro)  giving allowing dynamic interaction with the user

This folder contains visual representations of mathematical functions like:

#### Sprite movement

###### Sine movement
- 🎯 Sine-based vertical oscillation

# 🐍 Standalone Python Scripts
## casino.py 
A command-line slot machine simulation game built with Python. The user deposits money, chooses how many lines to bet on, and how much to bet per line. The game generates random symbols in a 3x3 grid and calculates winnings based on matching rows.

🔧 Features:

Configurable number of lines to bet on (1–3)</br>
Adjustable bet amount per line</br>
Randomized slot results based on weighted symbol probability</br>
Calculates and displays winnings per round and total balance</br>
Includes input validation and user-friendly prompts</br>

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

Randomized grid generation</br>
Probability weighting via symbol count</br>
Loop logic for game rounds</br>
Basic terminal I/O and validation</br>
Modular function design (deposit, spin, winnings check, etc.)</br>

#### Find.py
A mini game inspired from DORA where the user has to find a small dot on the screen and if he does the whole screen lights up and he wins.

### 🔐 pwguesser.py
A mini password guessing game built in Python. The program generates a 4-character password from randomly selected vowels. The user attempts to guess the password and receives feedback on how many characters are correct and in the correct position.

- Validates input length and disallows digits
- Randomly pops vowels to ensure non-repeating characters
- Provides a positional match score at the end

### 🐍 Sarpa (Snake Game)
A full Snake game built in Python using the `tkinter` library. The game features real-time movement, collision detection, a score counter, and a dynamic grid system.

- Real-time key input using `<KeyRelease>` bindings
- Food collision logic and snake growth
- Classic game loop running at 10 FPS
- Canvas-based rendering with position-tracked snake segments
